<p>In a world overrun by the undead, even the smallest mistake can cost your life. <strong>Undead Corridor</strong> is an HTML5 survival shooting game that throws you straight into a nightmare of bloodthirsty zombies and narrow escape routes. Every bullet, every move, and every breath counts as you fight for survival through endless corridors of horror.</p>

<p><strong>No downloads. No restrictions. You can play Undead Corridor instantly online at <a href="https://undeadcorridor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://undeadcorridor.io/</a>.</strong></p>

<h2>🧟‍♂️ Storyline & Setting – Zombie Survival Game</h2>
<p><strong>Undead Corridor</strong> puts you in the role of the last human survivor after a devastating zombie apocalypse has wiped out civilization. With humanity gone, your only mission is to fight back, scavenge for weapons, and push through a labyrinth of blood-soaked corridors, hospitals, rooms, and ruined streets crawling with the undead.</p>
<p>Each level is a new survival chapter – harder, deadlier, and faster. Your success depends on your ability to observe, react, and shoot with precision.</p>

<h2>⚔️ Gameplay Overview – Action & Shooting Mechanics</h2>
<p>The gameplay of <strong>Undead Corridor</strong> is simple to learn yet brutally challenging to master. You control your survivor using <strong>A / D</strong> or <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move, <strong>left-click</strong> to shoot, and <strong>Spacebar</strong> to kick zombies away when they get too close.</p>

<h3>🎯 Scoring System – Points & Rewards</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Headshot:</strong> +$10 and 5 points</li>
  <li><strong>Body shot:</strong> +$5 and 2.5 points</li>
  <li><strong>Leg shot:</strong> +$2 and 1 point</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the money to purchase new weapons or buy extra lives (each life costs $2500). When you die, your purchased weapons are lost, but your earned money remains — allowing you to prepare better for the next run.</p>

<h2>💀 Types Of Zombies – Enemies & Challenges</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Common zombies:</strong> Weak and unarmored; two headshots will take them down.</li>
  <li><strong>Green-uniform zombies:</strong> Equipped with helmets and body armor. Shoot their legs first to weaken them before finishing the kill.</li>
  <li><strong>Blue-uniform zombies:</strong> Wear helmets but no body armor, making them easier to take down with body shots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some zombies are even smart enough to cover their heads with their hands, forcing you to adapt and aim for other weak points.</p>
